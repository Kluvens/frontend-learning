## Basics
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:
- A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
- In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML elements.
- HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.\

### HTML documents
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: ```<!DOCTYPE html>```.

The HTML document itself begins with ```<html>``` and ends with ```</html>```.

The visible part of the HTML document is between ```<body>``` and ```</body>```.

### HTML headings
HTML headings are defined with the ```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` tags.
```<h1>``` defines the most important heading. ```<h6>``` defines the least important heading

### HTML paragraphs
HTML paragraphs are defined with the ```<p>``` tag
e.g. ```<p>This is a paragraph.</p>```

### HTML links
HTML links are defined with the ```<a>``` tag
e.g. ```<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>```

### HTML images
HTML images are defined with the ```<img>``` tag.

The source file (```src```), alternative text (```alt```), ```width```, and ```height``` are provided as attributes

e.g. ```<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">```
